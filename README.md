# Website Copier

Welcome to the Website Copier project repository! This project is designed to scrape website content and provide it as a downloadable zip file. It offers two types of functionality: scraping using the `wget` method and scraping using the `requests` method. It utilizes Flask, BeautifulSoup, requests, Selenium, and Flask-SocketIO for its functionalities.

## Features

- **Scraping Functionality**: Copy the content of a website and package it into a zip file for download.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Support for scraping websites with dynamic content using Selenium WebDriver.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor the progress of the scraping process in real-time using WebSocket communication.
- **Two Scraping Methods**: Supports scraping using both `requests` and `wget` methods.
